# ContactlessAttendanceSystem
This is one of my first Python projects, which works on the simple principle of Facial Recognition using the openCV and Numpy libraries of python. It is built on the basis of machine learning. 
# Description
The code is basically the trial version of the face recognition matrix. It learns how to perform Facial recognition with high accuracy. Basic implementation of this project is in the "practice.py". After that it will create an Attendance project that will use webcam to detect faces and record the attendance live in an excel sheet.
